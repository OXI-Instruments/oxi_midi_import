# OXI Midi Import

Dart package used by the OXI App to import monophonic, polyphonic sequences and grooves from MIDI files.

## Getting Started
The goal of this package is to read MIDI files and generate mono and poly patterns as output.
The package uses `dart_midi_pro` to parse the incoming MIDI files.
The output models can be found in the [`models`](lib/src/models) folder.
